Naruto: Shippuden S.01 E.30

Deidara, "Hm?"
Deidara, "What is that?"
Kakashi, "That’s what Master Jiraiya was talking about…"
Kakashi, "The Nine-Tails’ Cloak, huh?"
Naruto, "Hyaaa!"
Deidara, "So that’s the Jinchuriki’s…"
Deidara, "No wonder… his punches were so hard."
Naruto SC, "Kuh…!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Naruto SC, "It’s so hot…! Kuh…"
Naruto SC, "Kuh… Kuh…!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Jiraiya, "Listen carefully, Kakashi."
Jiraiya, "At some point, the Nine-Tails’ chakra may leak out of Naruto’s body and take the form of the Fox Spirit."
Kakashi, "The chakra will turn into the Fox Spirit?"
Jiraiya, "You can refer to it as the Nine-Tails’ Cloak."
Kakashi, "The Nine-Tails’ Cloak…?"
Jiraiya, "If the Nine-Tails’ Cloak appears, you must be careful!"
Kakashi, "Ah…"
Jiraiya, "Listen carefully. You must stop it while there’s still only one tail."
Jiraiya, "If you don’t… you’ll end up seeing something frightening."
Naruto SC, "Ngh… Ahh… Kuh…!"
Kakashi, "Tsk… Right from the start…"
Kakashi, "Calm down, Naruto!"
Naruto, "Haa… Hyaa!"
Kakashi, "Ah…!"
Kakashi, "He’s lost his ability to think calmly and rationally."
Kakashi, "It’s dangerous to approach him carelessly."
Jiraiya, "If the need arises, use this."
Jiraiya, "With this, you can immediately suppress the chakra."
Kakashi, "Woah…"
Naruto SC, "Ugh…"
Naruto SC, "We’re saved…"
Kakashi, "Have you calmed down, Naruto?"
Kakashi, "What in the world did Master Jiraiya see?"
Deidara, "I got to see something pretty cool… Yeah."
Deidara, "Someone’s… coming…"
Sakura, "We finally meet up."
Naruto, "S-Sakura…"
Kakashi, "You did well to find us here."
Sakura, "We felt a huge tremor earlier."
Naruto, "You guys did it, huh?"
Sakura, "Yeah."
Chiyo, "It looks like you’re still having some trouble here…"
Kakashi, "Unfortunately…"
Chiyo, "What happened with Gaara?"
Naruto, "Ngh…"
Deidara, "Don’t tell me… I can’t believe my man Sasori got beaten by a little girl and that old hag…"
Deidara, "Eternal beauty that remains long into the future, my butt."
Deidara, "He goes and dies just like that…"
Deidara, "He was too confident in that form with its weakness in full view… Yeah!"
Deidara, "Well, from my standpoint, it was an ending befitting of an artist."
Deidara, "Ah…"
Might Guy, "Good work, Neji."
Might Guy, "Good work, Neji."
Neji, "Heh… I haven’t worked at all."
Deidara, "I see… That must be the Byakugan that’s passed down through the Leaf, along with the Sharingan… Yeah."
Deidara, "You used those eyes to approach me from my blind spot, huh?"
Deidara, "It’s the first time I’ve seen the real deal."
Deidara, "I’d like to see how it’s different from Itachi’s Sharingan. But I think escaping from this situation comes first now… Yeah."
Might Guy, "Heh! Now that Team Guy, the strongest in all the Leaf is here… you can’t escape!"
Rock Lee, "Exactly!"
Tenten, "Prepare yourself!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Naruto, "Ah…"
Kakashi, "Team Guy, huh?"
Tenten, "Hya!"
Deidara, "Ugh…!"
Rock Lee, "Hya!"
Deidara, "Hmph. Not bad."
Might Guy, "Strong Leaf Hurricane!"
Deidara, "Ngh…"
Rock Lee, "Here I go!"
Deidara, "Ngh…!"
Rock Lee, "Argh!"
Rock Lee, "There, there, there! There!!"
Neji, "8 Trigrams!"
Deidara, "Ah…!"
Neji, "Air Palm!"
Deidara, "Ngh… Ugh… Gah…!"
Deidara, "Ngh… Ah…!"
Deidara, "These guys sure are pesky!"
Deidara, "I’m sure it’s around here…"
Deidara, "Down there, huh?"
Neji, "Huh?"
Tenten, "He went down!"
Might Guy, "We don’t know what he’s planning."
Might Guy, "Don’t lower your guard!"
Rock Lee, "Roger!"
Kakashi, "Be careful, everyone!"
Deidara, "Hngh…!"
Deidara, "I’ll show you my ultimate work of art…"
Neji, "Ah…!"
Neji, "He’s concentrating his chakra in one spot all at once!"
Neji, "Don’t tell me… Get back quickly, everyone!"
Sakura, "Ah…!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Deidara, "Art is explosive!"
Deidara, "I win!"
Chiyo, "Ah…"
Might Guy, "Ngh… What’s going on?!"
Rock Lee, "Ah…"
Naruto, "Ah…"
Kakashi, "I somehow made it in time…"
Kakashi, "Ngh… Ahh…"
Naruto, "Are you okay, Kakashi-sensei?"
Might Guy, "I’d expect no less from my rival."
Sakura, "What in the world did you do?"
Kakashi, "I blew the explosion… into another dimension."
Sakura, "Ah… Another dimension?"
Neji, "This is… a Sharingan Vision Jutsu…"
Rock Lee, "I don’t really get what happened, but the enemy has been defeated, right, Tenten?"
Tenten, "Hey! Don’t ask me that."
Kakashi, "Ngh… More importantly, is everyone okay?"
Naruto SC, "Ngh… Sakura…"
Naruto, "Sakura…"
Naruto, "Kuh… Ngh…"
Naruto, "Why? Why did… Why is it always Gaara? Did he have to die like this…?"
Naruto, "Ngh… He’s the Kazekage!"
Naruto, "He just became the Kazekage!"
Chiyo, "Calm down, Naruto Uzumaki."
Naruto, "Shut up!"
Naruto, "This wouldn’t have happened if you Sand Shinobi hadn’t put a monster inside Gaara!"
Naruto, "Did you even ask Gaara at all about how he felt?!"
Naruto, "Kuh… Ngh…!"
Naruto, "Jinchuriki, my butt."
Naruto, "You’ve no right to act so self-important by labelling us with that word you created!"
Sakura, "Naruto…"
Naruto, "I can’t save Sasuke… And I can’t save Gaara…"
Naruto, "I trained so hard for three years… Nothing’s changed since three years ago…!"
Sakura, "Ah…!"
Sakura, "Granny Chiyo…"
