Sarutobi, "Iruka…"
Iruka, "What is it, Lord Hokage?"
Sarutobi, "I know how you feel. You grew up just like him, without a parent’s love."
Iruka, "Huh? Who could it be at this hour?"
Iruka, "Mizuki-sensei! What’s wrong?"
Mizuki, "Please come to Lord Hokage’s office!"
Mizuki, "It seems Naruto pulled a prank and stole the Sacred Scroll!"
Iruka, "Huh?!"
Sarutobi, "It’s been over half a day since the scroll was taken."
Sarutobi, "Find Naruto immediately!"
Iruka, "Naruto! Hurry! Give me the scroll now!"
Iruka, "Mizuki’s after the scroll!"
Iruka, "Urgh… Ngh…!"
Naruto, "Ngh…"
Iruka, "Why… Naruto?"
Mizuki, "How did you know that I wasn’t Iruka?"
Naruto, "Hehe…"
Iruka, "I’m Iruka…"
Mizuki, "Ah…"
Iruka, "He’s a superior student that I acknowledge…"
Iruka, "He perseveres and he’s earnest, but he’s clumsy and no one accepts him."
Iruka, "He knows what human suffering is."
Iruka, "He is no longer the monster fox. He’s the Hidden Leaf’s…!"
Iruka, "Was that a dream…?"
Konohamaru, "Huh? Iruka-sensei, what’s this all about?"
Iruka, "Remember, you recorded me before?"
Konohamaru, "Huh? Oh yeah… That boring message with no style or punch."
Iruka, "C’mon, don’t say that. Could you just use that one?"
Konohamaru, "But you said you wanted to redo it, so I’ve been waiting around this whole time!"
Iruka, "I’m sorry about that."
Iruka, "But the more I think about it, the less sure I am about what to say to Naruto."
Konohamaru, "But you held out for so long, so you should just make up your mind and send him a cool, heartfelt message, okay?"
Konohamaru, "You’re the only one left!"
Iruka, "I’m sorry. I’ll treat you to a bowl of ramen next time, so please forgive me. Okay?"
Iruka, "Hey! Tsukune, Sansho, Mibuna!"
Iruka, "You were messing around with the Third Hokage’s statue again, weren’t you?!"
Sadoru, "I can’t believe it’s almost next week… Naruto’s wedding…"
Sadoru, "Will you be making an official congratulatory speech?"
Iruka, "Huh? Oh no… I think Lord Hokage will be taking care of that."
Ayame, "Iruka-sensei!"
Iruka, "Huh?"
Iruka, "Oh, you’re Ichiraku’s…"
Ayame, "Is anything the matter? You haven’t been around at all lately."
Iruka, "Oh, I just wanted to hold off until I figured out what to say for the message that Konohamaru asked me to do."
Iruka, "I have to practice some self-restraint."
Ayame, "So, did you finish your message?"
Iruka, "Well… uh…"
Iruka, "I’ll stop by again soon. Please say hello to your dad."
Boy 1, "What? That’s easy!"
Boy 2, "Then can you jump to here?"
Boy 1, "Hyaa!!"
Boy 1, "Ngh… Oww…"
Boy 2, "I knew it!"
Boy 1, "Shut up! I won’t lose at fence-jumping though!"
Naruto, "It’s all thanks to you."
Naruto, "You acknowledged me back then. That was the first time."
Naruto, "That’s why I am who I am today. I was able to change."
Iruka, "Naruto expressed his feelings so directly. What am I doing?"
Iruka, "Oww! Ah!"
Iruka, "Ahh!!"
Iruka, "Oh man… I really should do things I’m not used to!"
Iruka, "Huh? Yes?"
Iruka, "Oh… Naruto!"
Naruto, "H-Hey, Iruka-sensei."
Iruka, "W-What’s wrong?"
Naruto, "Nothing. It’s… well…"
Naruto, "I was thinking about you."
Naruto, "And I just stopped by to see if you were alive!"
Iruka, "What the hell’s that about?"
Naruto, "You know, I’m gonna be getting married."
Naruto, "And you’re still single and all, so I was worried about you being all alone."
Naruto, "I’m coming in!"
Iruka, "Hey, wait! I’m in the middle of…"
Naruto, "What happened?"
Iruka, "Uh, just some stuff…"
Iruka, "But what about you? What’s going on?"
Naruto, "Uh… well…"
Naruto, "Oh yeah!"
Naruto, "R-Ramen! Want to go get some ramen?"
Iruka, "Ramen?"
Iruka, "Actually, I’m making dinner right now."
Naruto, "Oh, that explains this crime scene right here."
Iruka, "Y-Yeah…"
Naruto, "You really should hurry up and get married, Iruka-sensei."
Iruka, "Shut up!"
Iruka, "What about you? Are you sure you should be neglecting Hinata right now?"
Naruto, "“Neglecting”? We’re not married yet, so don’t worry about it."
Iruka, "“Don’t worry about it”?"
Naruto, "My single days are numbered."
Naruto, "I’m gonna have fun with everything I’ve got --"
Iruka, "You fool!"
Naruto, "Gah!"
Iruka, "Do you even have a clue about how hard Hinata is working, preparing for your wedding?!"
Naruto, "What’s wrong, Iruka-sensei?"
Iruka, "It seems there were a lot of things I failed to teach you on how to be a human!"
Iruka, "I take full responsibility!"
Iruka, "Come with me! I’m gonna knock some sense into you!"
Naruto, "Huh?!"
Naruto, "Where are we going, Iruka-sensei?"
Iruka, "To Hinata’s!"
Iruka, "I’m going to apologize to her for raising you into such a thoughtless man!"
Naruto, "Please stop!"
Naruto, "If Hinata’s around, I won’t be able to say what I wanted to talk to you about!"
Iruka, "What do you want to talk about?"
Naruto, "T-That’s why I thought we could have some ramen…"
Naruto, "And you could have a drink or two!"
Naruto, "And then we could have an enjoyable conversation and have some fun."
Iruka, "Enough."
Naruto, "Huh?"
Iruka, "I guess I didn’t need to mull over what to say and how to congratulate you."
Naruto, "I have a request…"
Iruka, "A request?"
Naruto, "Will you attend the ceremony as my father?"
Iruka, "Naruto…?"
Iruka, "Is that what you wanted to talk about?"
Iruka, "You can leave it to me."
Naruto, "Iruka-sensei…"
Naruto, "Thank you."
Iruka, "What are you talking about, Naruto?"
Iruka, "I should be saying that. Thank you!"
Naruto, "Cut it out."
Naruto, "See you later, Iruka-sensei!"
Iruka, "Yeah!"
Iruka, "Good evening…"
Teuchi, "Hey!"
Ayame, "Oh…"
Teuchi, "Welcome!"
Ayame, "What’s going on?"
Teuchi, "Something troubling you again?"
Iruka, "Huh? No… I was just thinking about how glad I am that I chose this profession."
Teuchi, "I see."
Teuchi, "So, what’ll you have today?"
Iruka, "Oh, a large miso char siu ramen topped with naruto fishcake."
Teuchi, "One large miso char siu ramen!"
Ayame, "Okay, one large-size miso char siu ramen, coming right up!"
Iruka, "Hinata!"
Hinata, "Ah…"
Hinata, "Iruka-sensei?"
Iruka, "How are the preparations going?"
Hinata, "Just about all done. Now, we just have to wait for the big day."
Iruka, "That’s good."
Iruka, "Anyway, I… have something to tell you."
Iruka, "It’s about the wedding ceremony…"
Hinata, "You’re going to attend as Naruto’s father, aren’t you?"
Iruka, "Oh, you knew?"
Iruka, "Yeah, of course you would! Hahaha!"
Hinata, "Seems it was on Naruto’s mind for a long time."
Hinata, "You’re definitely Naruto’s teacher, Iruka-sensei, but he didn’t want to consider your relationship simply as a “student-teacher”and “mentor” relationship."
Iruka, "Huh?"
Iruka, "But I kind of feel like it shouldn't be coming from the point of view of a teacher to his student."
Iruka, "Naruto was thinking the same thing I was."
Iruka, "And so, his answer was to ask me to attend as his father."
Hinata, "Yes. And so, please continue to support him, Father!"
Iruka, "Ah…"
Iruka, "Y-Yes…"
Iruka, "It’s sort of embarrassing to be asked so formally."
Hinata, "Fufufu!"
Iruka, "So anyway…"
Hinata, "What is this?"
Iruka, "It’s not much, but please put it toward the reception fees."
Hinata, "Huh?!"
Iruka, "Naruto asked me to stand in as his father. I have to do this much, at least."
Hinata, "Please don’t worry about that!"
Hinata, "Please!"
Iruka, "I-Is that so?"
Iruka, "I guess I’ll just have to accept your answer and wait for the big day."
Iruka, "I wish I could’ve done something fatherly though…"
Hinata, "Fufufu!"
Iruka, "W-What is it?"
Iruka, "Fufufu. You look just like my father with that expression."
Iruka, "You’re already acting like the father of the groom."
Iruka, "Y-You think so? Hahaha!"
Konohamaru, "3, 2, 1… Rolling!"
Iruka, "Naruto, Hinata, congratulations on your wedding!"
Iruka, "Naruto!"
Iruka, "Haha…"
Konohamaru, "What’s the matter, Iruka-sensei?"
Konohamaru, "Lost for words again?"
Iruka, "Oh, sorry, sorry."
Iruka, "This time, I’ll do it right! So can I start over, just one more time?"
Konohamaru, "Ugh…"
Sakura, "Naruto, Hinata…"
Sakura, Sai, "Congratulations on your wedding!"
Rock Lee, "Please create a home as bright as the morning sun!"
Tenten, "May you always be happy!"
Might Guy, "Happy wedding!"
Ino, "Congratulations!"
Shikamaru, "Do your best!"
Chouji, "Don’t gorge yourself on delicious home-cooked meals!"
Shino, "Congratulations."
Kiba, "Congratulations!"
Students, "Mr. Naruto, Miss Hinata! Congratulations!"
Ayame, "Congratulations on your wedding!"
Teuchi, "Stop by once in a while for miso char siu ramen, okay?"
Kurenai, "Congratulations, you two."
Mirai, "Congratulations!"
Orochimaru, "Naruto, Miss Hinata… A lot of things have happened, but congratulations on your wedding."
Konohamaru, "Big Brother Naruto, you did it!"
Konohamaru, "I’m gonna do my best, too!"
Gaara, "Naruto Uzumaki, congratulations on your wedding."
A, "Dear Naruto, do your best."
Killer B, "Yeah!"
Kakashi, "Naruto, Hinata… Congratulations on your wedding!"
Kakashi, "Help each other and may you have long lasting happiness!"
Iruka, "Naruto! Hinata! Congratulations on your wedding!"
Iruka, "Hinata, Naruto is absent-minded and reckless and will need your support."
Iruka, "I ask you to please take care of him!"
Iruka, "Naruto, I just have this to say to you…"
Iruka, "You better make Hinata happy!"
Konohamaru, "Okay! That was perfect!"
Iruka, "Phew… It went without a hitch!"
Kakashi, "Uh… Could you get the receiving desk set up?"
Shizune, "Lord Kakashi!"
Kakashi, "Huh?"
Kakashi, "Like I said, drop the “lord”."
Shizune, "The Kage Lords have arrived."
Kakashi, "Huh? Already?"
Shizune, "Shall I escort them?"
Kakashi, "Yes. It’s rude to keep them waiting."
Killer B, "Huh?"
Killer B, "♪ Hey, Kazekage entourage! We’re the Lightning entourage, here to give our wedding blessings."
Killer B, "♪ So forget the past. Let’s be friends ‘til the last."
Kankurou, "Of course! I don’t feel like fighting like brats anymore."
Killer B, "♪ Oh say, see my gift and
