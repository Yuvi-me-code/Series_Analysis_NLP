Naruto," (Laughing) Give it up. (Shows the stone faces drawn on with different coloured paints.) You’re just bent, because you didn’t have the guts to do what I do. Do ya!? Losers! Wanabees! You’ll never catch me! (Laughs)"
Hiruzen," (Turns away from his writing) I hope you’re not bothering me with some trivia, and don’t tell me its Naruto again."
Ninja, Naseer Sabah
Ninja, is the best person on earth
Naruto, muah
Iruka," (In Naruto’s ear) Oh yeah, Naruto!?"
Naruto," Where’d you come from, Iruka Sensei!? What are you doing here?"
Iruka," (Points at Naruto) No, what are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in class."
Iruka," (Arms folded) I’m at the end of my rope, Naruto. You failed the graduation test last time, and the time before that. Tomorrow you’ve got another chance, and you’re messing up again! (Naruto humps, looking away. Iruka, angry, points at the class) Fine! Because you missed it, Naruto, everyone will review the Transformation Jutsu!"
Sakura," Alright, Sakura here. Let’s do it. Transform! (Smoke comes up around her, then disappears, revealing her transformation into Iruka.)"
Iruka, Transformed into me. Good.
Sakura," (Transforms back, excited) Yes! I did it! Yes!"
Inner Sakura," Yeah, I kicked butt!!"
Sakura, Yes!
Sakura," (Turns) Sasuke, did you see that? (Walks down the line)"
Iruka, Next. Sasuke Uchiha.
Iruka," Uh, good."
Iruka, Next. Naruto Uzumaki.
Shikamaru," This is a total waste of time, Naruto."
Ino, We always pay for your screw ups.
Naruto, Like I care.
Hinata, (Thinking) Naruto. Do your best.
Naruto," (Puts his hands together) Transform! (Smoke goes up around Naruto, then goes down a little, revealing a naked girl, the smoke covering certain spots, and blows a kiss)"
Iruka," Huh!? (Staring, shocked, knocked back)"
Naruto, Gotcha! That’s my Sexy Jutsu!
Iruka, (Yelling) Cut the stupid tricks! This is your last warning!
Naruto, This sucks. Loser.
Iruka,"(Arms crossed, sitting on top of the stone faces) You’re not going home till you’ve cleaned off every single drop of paint."
Naruto," (Stops scrubbing, looks up) So what? It’s not like there’s anyone waiting at home for me. (Goes back to scrubbing)"
Iruka, (Iruka looks down at Naruto) Naruto?
Naruto," (Looks up, eyes narrow and a pout on his face) What do you want now, Sensei?"
Iruka," Well, I was just thinking. Maybe after you clean this all up I can take you out for some ramen. The good stuff. What do you think? (Looks down at Naruto)"
Naruto, (Has a huge smile on his face. Beyond happy with that) Now that’s some serious motivation! I’ll have this clean in no time!
Iruka, Naruto?
Naruto, (Mouthful of noodles.) Mmmm...
Iruka," Why would you do that to the Hokage faces? I mean, you know who the Hokage are, don’t you?"
Naruto," Course I do. (Slurps more ramen. Then finishes the whole bowl, letting out a sigh afterwards.) Everybody knows. They were the greatest Shinobi of their time, right? The best of the best. Undefeated Ninja champs. (Naruto pictures the stone face of the Fourth Hokage, that he’d painted on)  And the Fourth Hokage’s the one who saved the village from the Nine-Tailed Fox. He was the most amazing."
Iruka, Then why did you...?
Naruto," Cause I’m going to be greater than any of them. Me. Naruto. The next Hokage! (Points his chopsticks) A Ninja legend! Then everyone will have to stop disrespecting me, and look up to me. Believe it! (pause. Iruka sucks up the noodle hanging out of the corner of his mouth.) Uh, by the way, I kinda wanna ask a little favour, Sensei."
Iruka, You want another bowl?
Naruto," (Shakes his head) Uh-uh. I... want to try on your headband. Come on, Please!? (Bows his head; begging)"
Iruka, Uh... (Motions to his headband) Oh this? No way. You can only wear the Leaf Headband when you finally graduate from the academy and become a Ninja. You’ve gotta pass the test tomorrow.
Naruto, That is so uncool! (Pouts)
Iruka, (Laughs) Hey? Is that why you took off your goggles?
Naruto, Ugh...! I want another bowl!
Iruka," We will now start the final exam. When your name is called, proceed to the testing room. The final test will be on... The Clone Jutsu."
Naruto, (Hands to his head; Thinking) Ugh! That’s my worst technique! Great. I’m never gonna pass!
Naruto," (Thinking) Alright. Get it together, Naruto. You can do this. (Puts his fingers together) Believe it. (Wind picks up around Naruto. Out loud) Clone Jutsu!"
Iruka, You fail!! (Naruto flips out) Hmm...
Mizuki," Iruka Sensei? (Iruka looks at him) He’s off, but his moves weren’t bad and he did hang in there and replicate. This is his third try, so you know he really wants to become a Ninja. We could cut him a break. (Naruto looks hopeful) And pass him."
Iruka, Mizuki Sensei. The other students created at least three effective replications. But Naruto could only create one. (Shot goes to Naruto’s clone) And look at it. It’s pitiful. (Naruto is shaking with anger) I can’t pass him.
Kid, You see that? They called me first.
Kid, I passed with flying colours.
Mother, (Off camera) Congratulations. I’m going to make you all of your favourites tonight. We’ll have a feast!
Ibara," There, you see him?"
Tsubaki, It’s that boy. I heard he’s the only one who failed.
Ibara, Hmph! Well it serves him right.
Tsubaki," Just imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja. (Naruto pulls his goggles down to cover his face.) I mean, he’s the boy who..."
Ibara, Shh... We’re not allowed to talk about that.
Hiruzen, Iruka. There is something we need to talk about.
Mizuki," Iruka Sensei is tough. But, he’s not against you."
Naruto, Then why? Why only me?
Mizuki," He wants you to be strong. With all his heart. But that will never happen if he goes easy on you. He’s like you, you know. No parents. No family."
Naruto, (Sad. Glum)  But... This time I really wanted to graduate.
Mizuki, (Chuckles quietly) Then I guess I’ll have to tell you.
Naruto, (Looks at him) Huh?
Mizuki, It’s a secret. But I’m gonna let you in on it.
Naruto," (Eyes wide, thinking) A secret?"
Hiruzen, Iruka.
Iruka," What is it, Lord Hokage?"
Hiruzen, I know how you feel. You grew up just like Naruto. Without knowing the love of a Mother and Father. The warmth of a family.
Ninja, It’s getting closer! Don’t let it near the village!
Young Iruka, Let me go! My Mom and Dad are still fighting back there! Ah!!!
Mizuki, Iruka Sensei. Wake up!
Iruka, What? What is it?
Mizuki, You need to come to Lord Hokage’s right away. It’s Naruto. He stole the Sacred Scroll.
Iruka, (Shocked) You mean the Scroll of Sealing? No!
Naruto," Let’s see... The first one is... Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu. (Puts a hand to his head, frustrated) Ah! Not this again. It’s my worst Jutsu!"
Iwana, The scroll contains secrets that were sealed by the first Hokage. Secrets known only to our village.
Yajirobee," If it falls into the wrong hands, they could destroy our entire way of life."
Hiruzen, Alright. Bring Naruto here at once!
s, Sir!
Iruka, (Thinking) Where would he go?
Mizuki," (Thinking) Now that I told everyone what Naruto did, I can eliminate him. They’ll be glad he’s gone. (Smiling evilly) And of course I keep the scroll for myself."
Iruka, It’s all over. (laughs)
Iruka, Huh?
Naruto," Got me already? Not bad. You’re quick, Sensei. I only had time to learn one technique."
Iruka, (Thinking) He’s been out here practicing. I can tell how hard he’s been working.
Naruto," (Happy) Listen, Iruka Sensei! I’m going to show you this amazing Jutsu and you’re going to let me graduate and everything will be okay. That’s the way it works, right? Anyone who learns Jutsu from this scroll passes."
Iruka, Huh? Where’d you get that idea?
Naruto," Mizuki Sensei told me about it. Believe it. (Turns to show the scroll on his back) He told me where to find the scroll... (Turns back to Iruka) ... And this place... (Naruto stops, noticing Iruka’s shocked face)"
Iruka, (Thinking) Huuh? Mizuki?
Iruka, Look out!
Mizuki, I see you’ve found our little hide away.
Iruka," (Looks up) So that’s the way it is, huh? I should’ve known."
Mizuki," Naruto! Give me the scroll, now!"
Naruto," Wait a minute... (looks over at Iruka, then back at Mizuki) What’s going on here? (Looks back at Iruka)"
Iruka," (Panting, pulls out the Kunai in his leg and throws it aside.) Naruto! Don’t let Mizuki get the scroll! (Mizuki is standing, looking down) It contains forbidden Jutsu, that could put this village in grave danger. Mizuki used you to get the scroll for himself. For his own power."
Mizuki, Naruto. (Holds out his hand) Iruka’s just trying to scare you cause he doesn’t want you to have the scroll.
Naruto, Huh? (Looks at Iruka)
Iruka," Stop lying, Mizuki. (Looks at Naruto) Don’t let him trick you, Naruto."
Mizuki," (Laughs) Oh, I’ll tell  you who’s really lying."
Iruka," No, Mizuki!"
Mizuki," They’ve been lying to you your whole life, Naruto. Since the decree 12 years ago."
Naruto, What decree?
Mizuki, Everyone knows except you. Iruka’s trying to hide it from you now. He’d do anything to shut me up.
Naruto," (looking up at Mizuki, wide eyed) What is this decree? Why does everyone else know about it?"
Iruka, Don’t tell him! It’s forbidden!
Mizuki," The decree is, no one can tell you the Nine-Tailed Fox is inside you! (Naruto stares, shocked) The Fox spirit that killed Iruka’s parents and destroyed our village has taken over your body. You are the Nine-Tailed Fox!"
Iruka, (Yelling) Stop it!
Mizuki," They’ve all been sneaking around, hiding things from you your whole life. Didn’t you think it was strange how they treated you? Like dirt. Like they hated you for just being alive."
Naruto," (Tears in his eyes) No...! (Naruto’s hands are out at his sides, and wind has come up around him) No, no, no, no!"
Iruka, Naruto...
Mizuki, That’s why you’ll never be accepted in this village. Even your beloved Sensei hates your guts!
Hiruzen," Iruka. Naruto never had a Mother or Father to care for him. He’s shut out of everything and doesn’t know why. Most people won’t even look at him. How would you feel if everywhere you went, people turned their backs on you? (Shows the desecrated stone faces) That’s why he gets in trouble. So people would notice him. It may not show, but he’s always thinking about the family he doesn’t have. He’s hurting inside."
Mizuki," Die, Naruto! (Throws the Shuriken)"
Iruka, Naruto! Get Down!
Naruto, W-Why?
Iruka," Because we’re the same. (Iruka remembers back to when he was a kid, with no parents) When I lost my parents, no one seemed to care. They didn’t have time for me. They just forgot I was there. (You see a young Iruka, trying to cross water on a rope, but he’s acting stupid, losing his balance. The other kids are laughing) My grades dropped. I became the class clown. (Young Iruka falls into the water, then he comes back up) I just wanted them to see me... (The young Iruka laughs, scratching his head, and the rest of the kids laugh) ... And know my name. My school wasn’t good enough to get the attention, so I did crazy things (Young Iruka sitting in the corner of a room, by himself) And then I had to pay for it. It was hard. (Back to the forest. Naruto is looking up at Iruka. Tears fall down onto Naruto’s cheek) I know that’s how you feel, Naruto. (Iruka is crying) You feel lonely and it hurts inside. And I could’ve been there for you more. (Naruto sits up a little) I let you down. I’m sorry. No one should have to suffer that much. No one should be alone like that. (Naruto’s lip trembles)"
Mizuki, (chuckles) Don’t make me laugh! Iruka always hated you. He was orphaned because the Nine-Tailed Fox killed his parents. And that beast is now inside you. He’d say anything to get the scroll from you.
Iruka, Naruto! (Reaches out) Naruto!!
Mizuki," (Jumps down, laughing) You know once he makes up his mind, nothing can change it. (Iruka’s hand drops. Naruto is still running) He’s going to use the scroll to take revenge on the village. (Stands up straight) You saw that look in his eye, didn’t you? Those are the eyes of a beast."
Iruka, (Pulls the Shuriken out of his back. Begins to stand) No. Naruto... (Begins to turn) Isn’t like that! (Throws the Shuriken)
Mizuki," (Dodges the Shuriken easily. It goes up into the trees) You’re a joke. As soon as I eliminate Naruto and get the scroll, I’ll be back for you. (Mizuki jumps away)"
Iruka, (Thinking) I won’t let you.
Hiruzen," This is not good. Mizuki has a big mouth. (Naruto can be seen running through the trees in the crystal ball) He made Naruto feel so bad. Worse than he’s ever felt. It could unleash the power inside of him. If Naruto keeps tampering with the scroll, the seal that locks the Fox spirit inside of him could be broken, and the beast could come out. If that happens, I fear for us all."
Iruka, Naruto! (Naruto looks at him) Everything Mizuki said was a lie. Give me the scroll. Hurry! (Iruka comes up in front of Naruto) He’s coming after you to take it away.
Iruka," (On his hands and knees) It can’t be... (Naruto takes the scroll off his back, and backs up to a tree, sliding down to the ground) How did you know, Naruto? (Iruka looks over his shoulder)"
Mizuki," (Smoke goes up around him, then disappears, revealing Mizuki.) ... That it was me, and not Iruka?"
Iruka, Because I’m Iruka.
Mizuki," (Stands up) You’re a fool. (Naruto is revealed, sitting behind a tree off to the side, holding the scroll.) Why are you protecting that freak? He’s the one who wiped out your family."
Iruka," I don’t care what you say, cause you’re not getting your hands on that scroll."
Mizuki, As if you could stop me. Don’t you get it? Naruto is just like me.
Iruka, How’s that?
Mizuki," He wants the scroll for his own power, and his own vengeance. That’s how beasts are. He’ll pour all his rage into the scroll and destroy everything."
Iruka, You’re right...
Naruto," (Gasps, shocked, then hugs the scroll.(Thinking) So it’s true. Iruka Sensei never believed in me. He thinks I’m some beast. Some kind of freak!"
Iruka," That is how beasts are. (Naruto’s eyes widen) But that’s not who Naruto is. (Naruto’s eyes are still wide) He’s nothing like that. Naruto’s one of a kind. Works hard. Puts his whole heart into it. Sure he messes up sometimes, and everyone jumps on him... But his suffering only makes him stronger. That’s what separates him from being a beast. So you’re wrong. He’s nothing like the Nine-Tailed Fox. He’s Naruto Uzumaki, of the village hidden in the leaves. (Naruto is crying)"
Mizuki," (Reaches around to his last Shuriken on his back) Hmph! You really believe that dribble? (Pulls the Shuriken off his back) Iruka, I was going to save you for later but I changed my mind. (Spins the Shuriken) You’re finished! (Mizuki runs at Iruka)"
Iruka, (Thinking) So this is it...?
Iruka, (Thinking) Naruto?
Mizuki," (Looks back at Naruto) Not bad, for a little punk."
Naruto," (Staring at Mizuki, half of his face shadowed) If you ever lay a hand on my Sensei... I’ll kill you!"
Mizuki, (Standing) Such big words. I can completely destroy you with a single move!
Naruto," (In his stance; 2 fingers crossed over his other 2 fingers, to form a “+” in front of his face) Take your best shot, fool. I’ll give it back to you a thousand fold!"
Mizuki," Let’s see you try! Show me what you can do, Nine-Tailed Fox!"
Naruto, Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Iruka," (thinking) Naruto... Those aren’t just Illusions. (Iruka sits up, smiling) They’re solid clones! He’s mastered an extremely advanced Jutsu."
Mizuki," Huh? (Stumbles around) What is this? (Mizuki falls back, and moves back) No..."
Naruto Clone, If you’re not coming...
Naruto Clone, Then we’re gonna come after you!
Naruto," Sorry. I kinda got carried away. (Drops his hand. Looks at Iruka) You okay, Iruka Sensei?"
Iruka, (Lets out a breath) Yeah... (Thinking) He’s amazing. He wants to surpass all the Hokage... And I’m starting to believe he might do it. (Lets out another breath) Naruto. Come here a minute. I’ve got something I want to give you.
Hiruzen,  There’s no longer any need to worry.
Ninja, Lord Hokage...?
Hiruzen, The scrolls safe. Naruto will be back soon.
Naruto, Sensei? How much longer?
Iruka, Okay. You can open your eyes now.
Iruka," Congratulations. You graduate. Naruto’s standing there, shocked. On his head, is Iruka’s Leaf headband) And to celebrate, I have a surprise. We’re going out for Ramen tonight."
Iruka, (Opens his eyes) Huh?
Naruto," Iruka Sensei! (Naruto jumps at him, hugging him, and Iruka falls back down)"
Iruka, (Laughing) Ah! That hurts!
Iruka," (Thinking) Naruto. This is only the beginning. The road gets tougher now that you’re a Ninja. But if I told you that, I guess it would ruin the moment. So I’ll tell you later. Over 500 bowls of Ramen."

Deidara, "Hm?"
Deidara, "What is that?"
Kakashi, "That’s what Master Jiraiya was talking about…"
Kakashi, "The Nine-Tails’ Cloak, huh?"
Naruto, "Hyaaa!"
Deidara, "So that’s the Jinchuriki’s…"
Deidara, "No wonder… his punches were so hard."
Naruto SC, "Kuh…!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Naruto SC, "It’s so hot…! Kuh…"
Naruto SC, "Kuh… Kuh…!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Jiraiya, "Listen carefully, Kakashi."
Jiraiya, "At some point, the Nine-Tails’ chakra may leak out of Naruto’s body and take the form of the Fox Spirit."
Kakashi, "The chakra will turn into the Fox Spirit?"
Jiraiya, "You can refer to it as the Nine-Tails’ Cloak."
Kakashi, "The Nine-Tails’ Cloak…?"
Jiraiya, "If the Nine-Tails’ Cloak appears, you must be careful!"
Kakashi, "Ah…"
Jiraiya, "Listen carefully. You must stop it while there’s still only one tail."
Jiraiya, "If you don’t… you’ll end up seeing something frightening."
Naruto SC, "Ngh… Ahh… Kuh…!"
Kakashi, "Tsk… Right from the start…"
Kakashi, "Calm down, Naruto!"
Naruto, "Haa… Hyaa!"
Kakashi, "Ah…!"
Kakashi, "He’s lost his ability to think calmly and rationally."
Kakashi, "It’s dangerous to approach him carelessly."
Jiraiya, "If the need arises, use this."
Jiraiya, "With this, you can immediately suppress the chakra."
Kakashi, "Woah…"
Naruto SC, "Ugh…"
Naruto SC, "We’re saved…"
Kakashi, "Have you calmed down, Naruto?"
Kakashi, "What in the world did Master Jiraiya see?"
Deidara, "I got to see something pretty cool… Yeah."
Deidara, "Someone’s… coming…"
Sakura, "We finally meet up."
Naruto, "S-Sakura…"
Kakashi, "You did well to find us here."
Sakura, "We felt a huge tremor earlier."
Naruto, "You guys did it, huh?"
Sakura, "Yeah."
Chiyo, "It looks like you’re still having some trouble here…"
Kakashi, "Unfortunately…"
Chiyo, "What happened with Gaara?"
Naruto, "Ngh…"
Deidara, "Don’t tell me… I can’t believe my man Sasori got beaten by a little girl and that old hag…"
Deidara, "Eternal beauty that remains long into the future, my butt."
Deidara, "He goes and dies just like that…"
Deidara, "He was too confident in that form with its weakness in full view… Yeah!"
Deidara, "Well, from my standpoint, it was an ending befitting of an artist."
Deidara, "Ah…"
Might Guy, "Good work, Neji."
Might Guy, "Good work, Neji."
Neji, "Heh… I haven’t worked at all."
Deidara, "I see… That must be the Byakugan that’s passed down through the Leaf, along with the Sharingan… Yeah."
Deidara, "You used those eyes to approach me from my blind spot, huh?"
Deidara, "It’s the first time I’ve seen the real deal."
Deidara, "I’d like to see how it’s different from Itachi’s Sharingan. But I think escaping from this situation comes first now… Yeah."
Might Guy, "Heh! Now that Team Guy, the strongest in all the Leaf is here… you can’t escape!"
Rock Lee, "Exactly!"
Tenten, "Prepare yourself!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Naruto, "Ah…"
Kakashi, "Team Guy, huh?"
Tenten, "Hya!"
Deidara, "Ugh…!"
Rock Lee, "Hya!"
Deidara, "Hmph. Not bad."
Might Guy, "Strong Leaf Hurricane!"
Deidara, "Ngh…"
Rock Lee, "Here I go!"
Deidara, "Ngh…!"
Rock Lee, "Argh!"
Rock Lee, "There, there, there! There!!"
Neji, "8 Trigrams!"
Deidara, "Ah…!"
Neji, "Air Palm!"
Deidara, "Ngh… Ugh… Gah…!"
Deidara, "Ngh… Ah…!"
Deidara, "These guys sure are pesky!"
Deidara, "I’m sure it’s around here…"
Deidara, "Down there, huh?"
Neji, "Huh?"
Tenten, "He went down!"
Might Guy, "We don’t know what he’s planning."
Might Guy, "Don’t lower your guard!"
Rock Lee, "Roger!"
Kakashi, "Be careful, everyone!"
Deidara, "Hngh…!"
Deidara, "I’ll show you my ultimate work of art…"
Neji, "Ah…!"
Neji, "He’s concentrating his chakra in one spot all at once!"
Neji, "Don’t tell me… Get back quickly, everyone!"
Sakura, "Ah…!"
Kakashi, "Ngh…"
Deidara, "Art is explosive!"
Deidara, "I win!"
Chiyo, "Ah…"
Might Guy, "Ngh… What’s going on?!"
Rock Lee, "Ah…"
Naruto, "Ah…"
Kakashi, "I somehow made it in time…"
Kakashi, "Ngh… Ahh…"
Naruto, "Are you okay, Kakashi-sensei?"
Might Guy, "I’d expect no less from my rival."
Sakura, "What in the world did you do?"
Kakashi, "I blew the explosion… into another dimension."
Sakura, "Ah… Another dimension?"
Neji, "This is… a Sharingan Vision Jutsu…"
Rock Lee, "I don’t really get what happened, but the enemy has been defeated, right, Tenten?"
Tenten, "Hey! Don’t ask me that."
Kakashi, "Ngh… More importantly, is everyone okay?"
Naruto SC, "Ngh… Sakura…"
Naruto, "Sakura…"
Naruto, "Kuh… Ngh…"
Naruto, "Why? Why did… Why is it always Gaara? Did he have to die like this…?"
Naruto, "Ngh… He’s the Kazekage!"
Naruto, "He just became the Kazekage!"
Chiyo, "Calm down, Naruto Uzumaki."
Naruto, "Shut up!"
Naruto, "This wouldn’t have happened if you Sand Shinobi hadn’t put a monster inside Gaara!"
Naruto, "Did you even ask Gaara at all about how he felt?!"
Naruto, "Kuh… Ngh…!"
Naruto, "Jinchuriki, my butt."
Naruto, "You’ve no right to act so self-important by labelling us with that word you created!"
Sakura, "Naruto…"
Naruto, "I can’t save Sasuke… And I can’t save Gaara…"
Naruto, "I trained so hard for three years… Nothing’s changed since three years ago…!"
Sakura, "Ah…!"
Sakura, "Granny Chiyo…"

Naruto: Shippuden S.06 E.20

Jiraiya, "Three of them? What’s going on? How could there be three Rinnegans?"
Jiraiya, "It must be his jutsu… There’s some trick to it."
Shima, "Just when I was busy preparing dinner…"
Fukusaku, "Ma, never mind that. Just focus on the opponent before us!"
Shima, "What did you say?!"
Jiraiya, "I guess it’s about time I made my move!"
Jiraiya, "From this moment on, let Sage Jutsu prevail! Look above, upon the halos and heavenly canopies!"
Jiraiya, "Jiraiya the gallant --"
Fukusaku, Shima, "Quit yakking in my ears!"
Jiraiya, "Erk… Guh…"
Jiraiya, "My posturing keeps getting interrupted today!"
Shima, "Let’s end this quickly and go home! I have to get dinner ready!"
Fukusaku, "Ma, that guy’s eye is more important than dinner!"
Fukusaku, "Stay alert! It’s the ultimate ocular jutsu!"
Shima, "Like I care! Don’t you dare belittle a housewife’s dilemma of what to cook every day, you old geezer!"
Fukusaku, "How dare you use such a tone against me! I was just looking after you!"
Shima, "Don’t give me that!"
Jiraiya, "Ahh! Who are the ones yakking into whose ears again?"
Pain, "Not bad."
Jiraiya, "Now then, can we put your spousal differences aside and get this here over with?"
Shima, "Hmph! Guess I’ll just fry up something!"
Shima, "Boy, you provide the oil. Pa, you bring the Wind Style!"
Jiraiya, "Yes, ma’am!"
Jiraiya, "Sage Art: Bath of Boiling Oil!"
Jiraiya, "Ahh…"
Shima, "Did it work?"
Jiraiya, "The oil vanished?!"
Shima, "They ought to have been basted by it."
Fukusaku, "That one probably has tricks up his sleeve, too."
Jiraiya, "Shall we find out with close combat?"
Fukusaku, "Yes."
Jiraiya, "Massive Rasengan!"
Jiraiya, "He… He can absorb an entire jutsu?! So that’s what he did earlier…"
Fukusaku, "Behind us!"
Jiraiya, "Ah…!"
Fukusaku, "We got his back!"
Jiraiya, "What? He blocked my Sage Mode attack without looking!"
Jiraiya, "Sage Art: Kebari Senbon!"
Jiraiya, "Ah…"
Jiraiya, "Ngh…"
Jiraiya, "Not a single wasted movement. I would’ve gotten him if he’d dodged it…"
Jiraiya, "Instead, he blocked it by summoning without ever turning around."
Jiraiya, "What’s going on? Blocking my attacks not just once, but twice."
Jiraiya, "With no verbal signals or eye contact between them at all… Even if all three were sensory types, they still have to see an attack coming in order to counter it."
Jiraiya, "Kebari Senbon is my fastest jutsu with the widest attack range."
Jiraiya, "The only way to defend oneself against it is with a shield as he just did, and he did it without looking."
Jiraiya, "They’re no ordinary clones."
Fukusaku, "You said they have a trick up their sleeves, and you’re right."
Shima, "Hm?"
Fukusaku, "Have you noticed?"
Jiraiya, "What is it?"
Fukusaku, "When we got their back earlier, you picked the target and attacked from his blind spot, correct?"
Jiraiya, "I noticed that, too."
Jiraiya, "But there were no signs that they were signalling each other either verbally or with eye contact."
Fukusaku, "That’s it! It’s their eyes… All three have the same eyes!"
Jiraiya, "Huh?"
Fukusaku, "Suppose the three of them can share what they see with each other…"
Jiraiya, "Enabling their eyes to share images with one another… Is that it?"
Fukusaku, "Yes. That’s what I suspect."
Fukusaku, "Still, what in tarnation are they?"
Jiraiya, "This is bad. Under these circumstances where my ninjutsu are being nullified, to face all three at once is a bit too much."
Jiraiya, "At this rate, if I enter battle, I’ll be killed, even in Sage Mode."
Jiraiya, "I never imagined they would be this strong…"
Fukusaku, "Fall back for now, Jiraiya."
Jiraiya, "Yes, sir."
Shima, "Why are we running away?!"
Fukusaku, "We must analyze the Six Paths and come up with a strategy. We’ll need time for that."
Fukusaku, "They may look different, but all possessed the same eye. In short, they all have the Rinnegan of Six Paths."
Jiraiya, "Even if one of them is Nagato, I can’t believe there would be so many Rinnegan users crawling around."
Jiraiya, "What in the world is going on?"
Fukusaku, "Which one is the real Pain? Figuring out the main one isn’t the problem."
Fukusaku, "The real problem is the fact that three of them possess the Rinnegan of Six Paths."
Jiraiya, "Just who… and what is Pain?"
Fukusaku, "We don’t know that yet, but we can make a small deduction."
Fukusaku, "Their vision is linked, and they share images. That’s the ability those eyes hold."
Shima, "Which means what, then? And how is it an advantage?"
Fukusaku, "I’ll put it simply."
Fukusaku, "In the same way that three security cameras show different angles of the same image, those three are able to see three views at one time."
Fukusaku, "So if just one of them can see the target, the other two can counter with the ideal attack and with perfect timing without having to see their foe."
Fukusaku, "In other words, their field of vision is three times better. And unlike the Byakugan, they can always guard each other’s blind spots without weaving signs or manipulating chakra."
Shima, "Ngh… No wonder their combination is invincible."
Jiraiya, "Which means we have to split them up and fight each one separately. I’m positive I can win one-on-one."
Jiraiya, "Since they possess such eyes, fighting as a team would have to be their basic mode of attack."
Jiraiya, "Taijutsu isn’t going to work, and any ninjutsu will just be absorbed."
Fukusaku, "If taijutsu and ninjutsu won’t work, then it’ll have to be genjutsu!"
Shima, "Yes!"
Jiraiya, "But I am a dud when it comes to genjutsu."
Jiraiya, "Ah, but as I recall, you two were…"
Fukusaku, "Yes… If they’re former students of yours, Jiraiya, they know that you don’t use genjutsu. That might give us an opening."
Shima, "No way! I’m not gonna do it!"
Jiraiya, "Wh-What is it?"
Fukusaku, "Haa… World peace is hanging on this battle, Ma! This is no time to be selfish!"
Shima, "I don’t care about no old geezer’s senile prophecies!"
Fukusaku, "The Great Lord Elder told us to get along, remember?!"
Jiraiya, "Err… W-What is it that you object to so much?"
Shima, "Hmph… I can’t sing a duet with Pa at this plump ripe old age! It’s embarrassing!"
Jiraiya, "Huh? A duet?"
Fukusaku, "Our most powerful genjutsu involves appealing to the auditory senses of the victim through song."
Jiraiya, "Auditory senses? I see. That’s why we retreated!"
Fukusaku, "Correct. This genjitsu is powerful, but as soon as we make a sound, our whereabouts will be revealed, which is its weakness."
Fukusaku, "Also, there’s the harmony of the sounds… In other words, the genjutsu is placed with a melody. It requires a little time before it takes effect."
Fukusaku, "If they discover our whereabouts before they are caught in the genjutsu and attack, we will surely lose."
Fukusaku, "However, once they are caught in the genjutsu, our victory will be assured."
Fukusaku, "What’s wrong?"
Jiraiya, "If both your lives are ever in danger, I want you to free yourselves from my shoulders immediately."
Fukusaku, "Huh? Absolutely not! The fate of the ninja world depends on this battle!"
Jiraiya, "I have a plan, although it is a gamble, as well."
Fukusaku, "Do tell."
Jiraiya, "Please begin…"
Fukusaku, Shima, "Right."
Pain, "Ah…"
Pain, "What is that?"
Pain, "This is… the croaking of frogs…"
Pain, "Ah…"
Pain, "Is this a genjutsu?"
Pain, "It’s coming from in there."
Pain, "Ah…!"
Jiraiya, "Fire Style: Giant Flame Bombs!"
Pain, "So that’s your move!"
Jiraiya, "Good! My gamble’s a success! That big one went after the jutsu to absorb it!"
Jiraiya, "The first fellow only used summoning…"
Jiraiya, "And both times, it was the big fellow who absorbed my jutsu!"
Jiraiya, "Just as I suspected, each of them possesses only a single type of ability!"
Jiraiya, "Right now, the big fellow’s eyes are focused on the jutsu!"
Jiraiya, "One I blinded earlier."
Jiraiya, "Now, only one of them… is looking at me!"
Pain, "Ngh… I can’t move…"
Pain, "The dark swamp!"
Fukusaku, "Just a little more!"
Pain, "Ngh…"
Jiraiya, "Now we’re really one-on-one!"
Pain, "Ngh…"
Jiraiya, "I’m not letting you summon!"
Pain, "Ugh…"
Pain, "You got us…"
Jiraiya, "You are inside a genjutsu paralysis that binds your psyche. Now, none of your bodies, including your main body, will be able to move."
Pain, "Jiraiya-sensei, I didn’t expect a genjutsu like this from you."
Jiraiya, "I thought I taught you never to let your guard down, no matter who your opponent is, Nagato."
Jiraiya, "You erred in your decision."
Y.Nagato, "I just want to protect those two… no matter what kind of pain I have to endure."
Jiraiya, "I see."
Jiraiya, "Rather than rule the world through pain, I wish you had moved past the pain and harnessed your power to bring about peace in a positive way."
Gamamaru, "That disciple will become a ninja who will bring about a great change to the ninja world. That is what I saw in my dream."
Gamamaru, "Either great stability or great destruction the likes of which this world has never seen before. One of those two."
Jiraiya, "For just a little while, I believed you were the one."
Jiraiya, "Farewell."
Pain, "Ngh…!"
Pain, "Ahhh…"
Jiraiya, "It’s done…"
Jiraiya, "Are you both all right?"
Fukusaku, "Haa… This genjutsu is hard on the throat."
Shima, "It’s really hard keeping tempo with Pa. This jutsu ain’t easy at all!"
Shima, "Damages the throat, stretches the lower jaw ‘til it sags, creates wrinkles!"
Jiraiya, "Ah, my profound apologies. Please take your rest now."
Jiraiya, "I’ve made my decision."
Jiraiya, "Ah…"
Pain, "Didn’t you teach me never to let down your guard… Jiraiya-sensei?"
Jiraiya, "Ugh…"
Shima, "Lad! Your left arm!"
Jiraiya, "I’m aware of that!"
Fukusaku, "What’s going on?!"
Jiraiya, "This one’s got a different face from the other three. He was probably summoned earlier."
Fukusaku, "I see! Before they got caught in our genjutsu!"
Pain, "Now, then…"
Group, "Ah…!"
Pain, "In attendance… the Six Paths of Pain."
Jiraiya, "Ngh…"
Fukusaku, "Six? There are six of them?!"
Shima, "Ah… Hey, look close! The three we just did in are there, too!"
Fukusaku, "The newly summoned ones must have resurrected them with some sort of jutsu!"
Shima, "There’s even a jutsu that can revive as many as three of them when they were undoubtedly dead? Are they really human?!"
Jiraiya, "Pain… What are you?"
Pain, "Pain… That name is an alias that denotes all six of us!"
Jiraiya, "Why… are there six Rinnegan bearers?"
Jiraiya, "Ah!"
Jiraiya, "Y-You’re…!"

Naruto: Shippuden S.21 E.21

Sarutobi, "Iruka…"
Iruka, "What is it, Lord Hokage?"
Sarutobi, "I know how you feel. You grew up just like him, without a parent’s love."
Iruka, "Huh? Who could it be at this hour?"
Iruka, "Mizuki-sensei! What’s wrong?"
Mizuki, "Please come to Lord Hokage’s office!"
Mizuki, "It seems Naruto pulled a prank and stole the Sacred Scroll!"
Iruka, "Huh?!"
Sarutobi, "It’s been over half a day since the scroll was taken."
Sarutobi, "Find Naruto immediately!"
Iruka, "Naruto! Hurry! Give me the scroll now!"
Iruka, "Mizuki’s after the scroll!"
Iruka, "Urgh… Ngh…!"
Naruto, "Ngh…"
Iruka, "Why… Naruto?"
Mizuki, "How did you know that I wasn’t Iruka?"
Naruto, "Hehe…"
Iruka, "I’m Iruka…"
Mizuki, "Ah…"
Iruka, "He’s a superior student that I acknowledge…"
Iruka, "He perseveres and he’s earnest, but he’s clumsy and no one accepts him."
Iruka, "He knows what human suffering is."
Iruka, "He is no longer the monster fox. He’s the Hidden Leaf’s…!"
Iruka, "Was that a dream…?"
Konohamaru, "Huh? Iruka-sensei, what’s this all about?"
Iruka, "Remember, you recorded me before?"
Konohamaru, "Huh? Oh yeah… That boring message with no style or punch."
Iruka, "C’mon, don’t say that. Could you just use that one?"
Konohamaru, "But you said you wanted to redo it, so I’ve been waiting around this whole time!"
Iruka, "I’m sorry about that."
Iruka, "But the more I think about it, the less sure I am about what to say to Naruto."
Konohamaru, "But you held out for so long, so you should just make up your mind and send him a cool, heartfelt message, okay?"
Konohamaru, "You’re the only one left!"
Iruka, "I’m sorry. I’ll treat you to a bowl of ramen next time, so please forgive me. Okay?"
Iruka, "Hey! Tsukune, Sansho, Mibuna!"
Iruka, "You were messing around with the Third Hokage’s statue again, weren’t you?!"
Sadoru, "I can’t believe it’s almost next week… Naruto’s wedding…"
Sadoru, "Will you be making an official congratulatory speech?"
Iruka, "Huh? Oh no… I think Lord Hokage will be taking care of that."
Ayame, "Iruka-sensei!"
Iruka, "Huh?"
Iruka, "Oh, you’re Ichiraku’s…"
Ayame, "Is anything the matter? You haven’t been around at all lately."
Iruka, "Oh, I just wanted to hold off until I figured out what to say for the message that Konohamaru asked me to do."
Iruka, "I have to practice some self-restraint."
Ayame, "So, did you finish your message?"
Iruka, "Well… uh…"
Iruka, "I’ll stop by again soon. Please say hello to your dad."
Boy 1, "What? That’s easy!"
Boy 2, "Then can you jump to here?"
Boy 1, "Hyaa!!"
Boy 1, "Ngh… Oww…"
Boy 2, "I knew it!"
Boy 1, "Shut up! I won’t lose at fence-jumping though!"
Naruto, "It’s all thanks to you."
Naruto, "You acknowledged me back then. That was the first time."
Naruto, "That’s why I am who I am today. I was able to change."
Iruka, "Naruto expressed his feelings so directly. What am I doing?"
Iruka, "Oww! Ah!"
Iruka, "Ahh!!"
Iruka, "Oh man… I really should do things I’m not used to!"
Iruka, "Huh? Yes?"
Iruka, "Oh… Naruto!"
Naruto, "H-Hey, Iruka-sensei."
Iruka, "W-What’s wrong?"
Naruto, "Nothing. It’s… well…"
Naruto, "I was thinking about you."
Naruto, "And I just stopped by to see if you were alive!"
Iruka, "What the hell’s that about?"
Naruto, "You know, I’m gonna be getting married."
Naruto, "And you’re still single and all, so I was worried about you being all alone."
Naruto, "I’m coming in!"
Iruka, "Hey, wait! I’m in the middle of…"
Naruto, "What happened?"
Iruka, "Uh, just some stuff…"
Iruka, "But what about you? What’s going on?"
Naruto, "Uh… well…"
Naruto, "Oh yeah!"
Naruto, "R-Ramen! Want to go get some ramen?"
Iruka, "Ramen?"
Iruka, "Actually, I’m making dinner right now."
Naruto, "Oh, that explains this crime scene right here."
Iruka, "Y-Yeah…"
Naruto, "You really should hurry up and get married, Iruka-sensei."
Iruka, "Shut up!"
Iruka, "What about you? Are you sure you should be neglecting Hinata right now?"
Naruto, "“Neglecting”? We’re not married yet, so don’t worry about it."
Iruka, "“Don’t worry about it”?"
Naruto, "My single days are numbered."
Naruto, "I’m gonna have fun with everything I’ve got --"
Iruka, "You fool!"
Naruto, "Gah!"
Iruka, "Do you even have a clue about how hard Hinata is working, preparing for your wedding?!"
Naruto, "What’s wrong, Iruka-sensei?"
Iruka, "It seems there were a lot of things I failed to teach you on how to be a human!"
Iruka, "I take full responsibility!"
Iruka, "Come with me! I’m gonna knock some sense into you!"
Naruto, "Huh?!"
Naruto, "Where are we going, Iruka-sensei?"
Iruka, "To Hinata’s!"
Iruka, "I’m going to apologize to her for raising you into such a thoughtless man!"
Naruto, "Please stop!"
Naruto, "If Hinata’s around, I won’t be able to say what I wanted to talk to you about!"
Iruka, "What do you want to talk about?"
Naruto, "T-That’s why I thought we could have some ramen…"
Naruto, "And you could have a drink or two!"
Naruto, "And then we could have an enjoyable conversation and have some fun."
Iruka, "Enough."
Naruto, "Huh?"
Iruka, "I guess I didn’t need to mull over what to say and how to congratulate you."
Naruto, "I have a request…"
Iruka, "A request?"
Naruto, "Will you attend the ceremony as my father?"
Iruka, "Naruto…?"
Iruka, "Is that what you wanted to talk about?"
Iruka, "You can leave it to me."
Naruto, "Iruka-sensei…"
Naruto, "Thank you."
Iruka, "What are you talking about, Naruto?"
Iruka, "I should be saying that. Thank you!"
Naruto, "Cut it out."
Naruto, "See you later, Iruka-sensei!"
Iruka, "Yeah!"
Iruka, "Good evening…"
Teuchi, "Hey!"
Ayame, "Oh…"
Teuchi, "Welcome!"
Ayame, "What’s going on?"
Teuchi, "Something troubling you again?"
Iruka, "Huh? No… I was just thinking about how glad I am that I chose this profession."
Teuchi, "I see."
Teuchi, "So, what’ll you have today?"
Iruka, "Oh, a large miso char siu ramen topped with naruto fishcake."
Teuchi, "One large miso char siu ramen!"
Ayame, "Okay, one large-size miso char siu ramen, coming right up!"
Iruka, "Hinata!"
Hinata, "Ah…"
Hinata, "Iruka-sensei?"
Iruka, "How are the preparations going?"
Hinata, "Just about all done. Now, we just have to wait for the big day."
Iruka, "That’s good."
Iruka, "Anyway, I… have something to tell you."
Iruka, "It’s about the wedding ceremony…"
Hinata, "You’re going to attend as Naruto’s father, aren’t you?"
Iruka, "Oh, you knew?"
Iruka, "Yeah, of course you would! Hahaha!"
Hinata, "Seems it was on Naruto’s mind for a long time."
Hinata, "You’re definitely Naruto’s teacher, Iruka-sensei, but he didn’t want to consider your relationship simply as a “student-teacher”and “mentor” relationship."
Iruka, "Huh?"
Iruka, "But I kind of feel like it shouldn't be coming from the point of view of a teacher to his student."
Iruka, "Naruto was thinking the same thing I was."
Iruka, "And so, his answer was to ask me to attend as his father."
Hinata, "Yes. And so, please continue to support him, Father!"
Iruka, "Ah…"
Iruka, "Y-Yes…"
Iruka, "It’s sort of embarrassing to be asked so formally."
Hinata, "Fufufu!"
Iruka, "So anyway…"
Hinata, "What is this?"
Iruka, "It’s not much, but please put it toward the reception fees."
Hinata, "Huh?!"
Iruka, "Naruto asked me to stand in as his father. I have to do this much, at least."
Hinata, "Please don’t worry about that!"
Hinata, "Please!"
Iruka, "I-Is that so?"
Iruka, "I guess I’ll just have to accept your answer and wait for the big day."
Iruka, "I wish I could’ve done something fatherly though…"
Hinata, "Fufufu!"
Iruka, "W-What is it?"
Iruka, "Fufufu. You look just like my father with that expression."
Iruka, "You’re already acting like the father of the groom."
Iruka, "Y-You think so? Hahaha!"
Konohamaru, "3, 2, 1… Rolling!"
Iruka, "Naruto, Hinata, congratulations on your wedding!"
Iruka, "Naruto!"
Iruka, "Haha…"
Konohamaru, "What’s the matter, Iruka-sensei?"
Konohamaru, "Lost for words again?"
Iruka, "Oh, sorry, sorry."
Iruka, "This time, I’ll do it right! So can I start over, just one more time?"
Konohamaru, "Ugh…"
Sakura, "Naruto, Hinata…"
Sakura, Sai, "Congratulations on your wedding!"
Rock Lee, "Please create a home as bright as the morning sun!"
Tenten, "May you always be happy!"
Might Guy, "Happy wedding!"
Ino, "Congratulations!"
Shikamaru, "Do your best!"
Chouji, "Don’t gorge yourself on delicious home-cooked meals!"
Shino, "Congratulations."
Kiba, "Congratulations!"
Students, "Mr. Naruto, Miss Hinata! Congratulations!"
Ayame, "Congratulations on your wedding!"
Teuchi, "Stop by once in a while for miso char siu ramen, okay?"
Kurenai, "Congratulations, you two."
Mirai, "Congratulations!"
Orochimaru, "Naruto, Miss Hinata… A lot of things have happened, but congratulations on your wedding."
Konohamaru, "Big Brother Naruto, you did it!"
Konohamaru, "I’m gonna do my best, too!"
Gaara, "Naruto Uzumaki, congratulations on your wedding."
A, "Dear Naruto, do your best."
Killer B, "Yeah!"
Kakashi, "Naruto, Hinata… Congratulations on your wedding!"
Kakashi, "Help each other and may you have long lasting happiness!"
Iruka, "Naruto! Hinata! Congratulations on your wedding!"
Iruka, "Hinata, Naruto is absent-minded and reckless and will need your support."
Iruka, "I ask you to please take care of him!"
Iruka, "Naruto, I just have this to say to you…"
Iruka, "You better make Hinata happy!"
Konohamaru, "Okay! That was perfect!"
Iruka, "Phew… It went without a hitch!"
Kakashi, "Uh… Could you get the receiving desk set up?"
Shizune, "Lord Kakashi!"
Kakashi, "Huh?"
Kakashi, "Like I said, drop the “lord”."
Shizune, "The Kage Lords have arrived."
Kakashi, "Huh? Already?"
Shizune, "Shall I escort them?"
Kakashi, "Yes. It’s rude to keep them waiting."
Killer B, "Huh?"
Killer B, "♪ Hey, Kazekage entourage! We’re the Lightning entourage, here to give our wedding blessings."
Killer B, "♪ So forget the past. Let’s be friends ‘til the last."
Kankurou, "Of course! I don’t feel like fighting like brats anymore."
Killer B, "♪ Oh say, see my gift and
